# Pitfalls / Things to keep in mind

## Key IDs are really not guaranteed to be unique

Use fingerprints, or expect duplicates

## Signature Subpackets can have duplicates

## Packet Nesting can be unreasonable

- EBNF of allowed packet sequences is complex -> Recommend [stricter](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/openpgp/uepOF6XpSegMO4c59tt9e5H1i4g/) best-practices?
