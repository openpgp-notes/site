# Acknowledgements

OpenPGP is a manifestation of [the political vision of Phil Zimmermann](https://philzimmermann.com/EN/background/peace.html), reflecting his commitment to human rights and the peace movement. Therefore, we foremost acknowledge Phil, who, alongside early PGP developers,  worked with dedication and courage to introduce one of the first sophisticated cryptographic tools to the world, despite substantial personal risk. 

All subsequent projects in the OpenPGP space are indebted to the foundational ideas and principles of those early days[^puzzle], including the pivotal decision to standardize the OpenPGP format through the IETF.

[^puzzle]: These ideas and principles include some ongoing challenges, such as the puzzle of how to develop a scalable distributed PKI and trust model.

In the intervening three decades, many have contributed to the OpenPGP space. We recognize the civic-oriented work of those who have helped evolve the OpenPGP ecosystem into a tool for digital empowerment.
