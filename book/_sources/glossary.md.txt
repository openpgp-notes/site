Life-cycle Management
    In OpenPGP several actions are necessary for the prolonged use of an {term}`OpenPGP Certificate` or adapting its {term}`components<Component>` to the requirements of the {term}`Certificate Holder`.
    These are for example changes to {term}`binding signatures<Binding Signature>` (adding or {term}`revocation` of {term}`component keys<Component Key>` or {term}`direct key signature<Direct Key Signature>`), modification of {term}`expiration time` or other {term}`metadata` for {term}`components<Component>`.

Signature Verification
    In cryptography the mechanism of verification relates to a process in which a claim (i.e., a {term}`signature`) is tested (i.e., using the relevant {term}`components<Component>` of a {term}`certificate`).

Signer
    A {term}`Certificate Holder`, that is able to create {term}`self-signatures<Self-signature>` and {term}`third-party signatures<Third-party Signature>`.

Strong Authentication
    "Strong Authentication" in this text refers to having ascertained that a {term}`certificate<OpenPGP Certificate>` and an {term}`identity claim` on it are legitimately linked. That is, that the person who controls the {term}`certificate<OpenPGP Certificate>` is correctly represented by the {term}`identity component`.
     
     Strong authentication in OpenPGP is typically encoded with a {term}`certification signature`.
     
     Ascertaining strong authentication requires an out-of-band check: Either via a manual {term}`verification` process, or an automated system that can {term}`certify<Certification>` that a user has identified to the system that issues the {term}`identity` in question (e.g. an email provider can {term}`certify<Certification>` email-based {term}`identities<Identity>` that it issues to the user).
    
    Also see {term}`Authentication`.

Subkey
    See {term}`OpenPGP Subkey`.

Subkey Binding Signature

    A {term}`Self-signature` to {term}`revoke<Revocation>` an {term}`OpenPGP Subkey` in an {term}`OpenPGP Certificate`.

Symmetrically Encrypted Integrity Protected Data
    Short *SEIPD*, this refers to {term}`Symmetric Cryptography` based encrypted data, which is used in a Symmetrically Encrypted Integrity Protected Data Packet.

    See [RFC 5.13](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-openpgp-crypto-refresh-12.html#name-symmetrically-encrypted-int).

Symmetric Secret Key
    The {term}`Private Key Material` used in {term}`Symmetric Cryptography`.

    A {term}`signature packet<OpenPGP signature packet>` with the {term}`Signature Type ID` `0x01`, which is used for textual data.

Third-party Identity Certification
    {term}`Certification` by third-parties to confirm ownership of an {term}`OpenPGP Certificate` by a {term}`Certificate Holder`. See [](third-party-identity-certifications).

Third-party Signature
    A {term}`Signature` by a third-party on a {term}`Component` of a {term}`Certificate`.

Transferable Secret Key
    A Transferable Secret Key (TSK) is the combination of an {term}`OpenPGP Certificate` and the associated {term}`private key material`. Also often referred to as an "OpenPGP private key". It is discussed in detail in [](/private_keys).

Trust Amount
    A numerical value between `0` and `255`, stored in {term}`trust signatures<Trust Signature>` used for indicating the degree of reliance on the {term}`delegation`.
    Values less than `120` indicate partial trust, values equal to or greater than `120` indicate complete trust.

    See [](trust-amounts).
    See [RFC 5.2.3.21](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-openpgp-crypto-refresh-12.html#name-trust-signature)

Trust Anchor
    An entity in a {term}`Trust Model` for which trust is assumed and not derived.

Trust Depth
    This numerical value is part of a {term}`Trust Signature` and describes the extent of trustworthiness of a {term}`Certification`, that the {term}`signer` assigns to it.

    See [](trust-depth-level).

Trust Level
    See {term}`Trust Depth`.

Trust Model
    A model by which trust between {term}`identities<Identity>` associated with different {term}`OpenPGP Certificates<OpenPGP Certificate>` is created. See [](third-party-identity-certifications).

Trust Root
    See {term}`Trust Anchor`.

Trust Signature
    The *trust signature* {term}`subpacket<OpenPGP Signature Subpacket>` on a {term}`certifying signature<Certification>` is used for {term}`delegation` of {term}`authentication` decisions. With this feature, an OpenPGP user can designate a {term}`certificate<OpenPGP Certificate>` as a "{term}`trusted introducer`" and opt to rely on {term}`certifications<Certification>` they issue.

    See [RFC 5.2.3.21](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-openpgp-crypto-refresh-12.html#name-trust-signature)

Trusted introducer
    OpenPGP users can choose to rely on {term}`certifications<Certification>` issued by a third party. The remote party of such a {term}`delegation` is called a "trusted introducer".
     
     See {ref}`delegation` for more details. 

TSK

tsig
    See {term}`Trust signature`

Unhashed Subpacket
    A {term}`Signature Subpacket` residing in the {term}`Unhashed Area` of a {term}`Signature Packet`.

    An {term}`Identity Component`, which describes an {term}`Identity` of a {term}`Certificate Holder`. See [](user-ids-in-openpgp-certificates).

User ID Binding Signature
    A {term}`Binding Signature`, which is created by an {term}`OpenPGP Primary Key` to bind a {term}`User ID` to an {term}`OpenPGP Certificate`.

Validation
    A mechanism by which the [operational needs of a use-case are met](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation#Validation).
    In OpenPGP terminology this may refer to processes such as ensuring, that an {term}`OpenPGP Signature Packet` has been created after a {term}`Transferable Secret Key`'s {term}`Creation Time`, but before its {term}`Expiration Time`.

Validity
    See {term}`Validation`.

Verification
    A mechanism by which the [compliance with design specifications are met](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation#Verification).
    In OpenPGP terminology this may refer to e.g. {term}`Signature Verification` or {term}`Identity Verification`.

Web Of Trust
    A {term}`trust model` which is based on a network of {term}`certifications<Certification>` and {term}`delegations<Delegation>`, that can be used to discern the reliability of {term}`certificates<Certificate>` and their associated {term}`identities<Identity>`. See [](wot).
